# Composum site www.composum.com

The Composum site [www.composum.com](https://www.composum.com) is the main site describing the composum features, which
is hosted on [cloud.composum.com](https://cloud.composum.com). This project contains the source code for that site. 
You are welcome to use this as an extensive example for using Composum Pages - either if you want to see how to 
develop components or structure a site using Composum, or just to load it into our
[Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/composum/featurelauncher-composum) with Composum Pages
to play around, try how editing works or perhaps have a look at our all new 
[Composum AI](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI). :-)
