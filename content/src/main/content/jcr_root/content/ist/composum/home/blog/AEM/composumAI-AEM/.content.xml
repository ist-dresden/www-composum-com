The Composum AI provides the editor in Adobe AEM with a seamless integration that allows analysing content, content generation and transformation according to the users wishes. It integrates two assistant dialogs with different focus and capabilities. Both of them offer a library with various prompt examples that can be used as is or modified into processing / analysis instructions to process page parts or the whole page text, or external texts into summaries, introductions, conclusions, rewrite texts, generate suggestions for extending texts, phrases, headlines and so forth.&lt;/p>"/>

So it would be easy to use e.g  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude&quot;>Anthropic's Claude&lt;/a> (UK) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bard.google.com/&quot;>Google's Bard&lt;/a> or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aleph-alpha.com/luminous&quot;>Aleph's Luminous&lt;/a>, once they are publicly available.&lt;/p>&lt;br>&lt;p>The frontend is integrated with Adobe AEM as a cloud service; we intend to make it usable on AEM 6.5.x, too.
